# Power BI Project: Telecom Diversity and Inclusion Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze diversity and inclusion within a telecom company's workforce, focusing on improving gender balance at the executive management level. Using Power BI, the analysis provides insights into current workforce demographics, identifies trends, and offers recommendations for fostering a more inclusive workplace.

## Objectives
- Assess the gender composition of the telecom company's workforce, particularly in executive roles.
- Identify factors influencing gender disparities.
- Provide visual dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:
- **customerID:** Unique identifier for each customer
- **gender:** Customer's gender
- **SeniorCitizen:** Binary indicator of senior citizen status
- **Partner:** Binary indicator of partnership status
- **Dependents:** Binary indicator of dependents
- **tenure:** Number of months the customer has stayed with the company
- **PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies:** Service usage indicators
- **Contract:** Type of contract (Month-to-month, One year, Two years)
- **PaperlessBilling:** Binary indicator of paperless billing
- **PaymentMethod:** Method of payment
- **MonthlyCharges:** Monthly charges incurred
- **TotalCharges:** Total charges to date
- **numAdminTickets, numTechTickets:** Number of administrative and technical support tickets
- **Churn:** Binary indicator of customer churn

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Transformed categorical variables into appropriate formats for visualization.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyzed gender distribution across different job roles and management levels.
   - Examined correlations between tenure, service usage, and gender diversity.

3. **Dashboard Design:**
   - Created interactive dashboards using Power BI, featuring KPIs, charts, and tables.
   - Included filters and slicers to allow users to explore specific subsets of data.

## Key Insights
- Gender representation at the executive management level is currently skewed, with fewer women holding leadership positions.
- Longer tenure and higher engagement in company services correlate with better retention rates, suggesting opportunities for gender-focused retention programs.

## Recommendations
- Implement targeted recruitment and mentorship programs to support women in advancing to executive roles.
- Monitor diversity metrics regularly using Power BI dashboards to track progress and adjust strategies accordingly.

## How to Use the Power BI Dashboard
1. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) using Power BI Desktop.
2. Navigate through different tabs to explore various analyses.
3. Use filters and slicers to focus on specific demographics, tenure ranges, or service usage.

## Future Work
- Extend the analysis to include additional diversity factors such as age, ethnicity, and disability status.
- Integrate employee feedback surveys to assess workplace culture and inclusivity.
